Observed by: Vietnamese
Significance: Marks the North Vietnamese capture of Saigon
Held on: April 30

**Reunification Day** (*Ngày Thống nhất*), **Victory Day** (*Ngày Chiến thắng*) or **Liberation Day** (*Ngày Giải phóng* or *Ngày Giải phóng miền Nam*) is a public holiday in Vietnam that marks the event when Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops captured Saigon (now [Ho Chi Minh City][]) on April 30, 1975. This signalled the end of the Vietnam War, known in Vietnamese as Chiến tranh Việt Nam (Vietnam War) or Kháng chiến chống Mỹ ("Resistance War Against America"). It was the start of the transition period toward reunification, which occurred July 2, 1976, when the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam and North Vietnam merged to form the modern-day Vietnam or the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

The anniversary is marked by several festivals around the date.

In the Overseas Vietnamese community, the day is remembered as the "Fall of Saigon", "Black April (Tháng Tư Đen)", National Day of Shame (Ngày Quốc Nhục) or National Day of Resentment (Ngày Quốc Hận). This is a commemorative day for exiled Vietnamese who served, were affected, and displaced in those overseas communities, and as such is a day of reflection.
